# Unity3D-Hacking-Guide

Max Bridgland

## Forward

The point of this repository is to make the process of creating hacks for Unity easier to get into for anybody. It seems there aren't many good, comprehensive tutorials on this subject apart from some great threads on UC and GuidedHacking. However, even those guides are pretty lack-luster and give you the bare minimum information for ways doing things. This repository is going to grow as I personally learn more about Unity hacking and what not. Make sure to **Watch** this repo to make sure you can stay up to date as I add chapters.
